# Post-Project Reflection: [Project Title]

## Overview
[Provide a brief summary of the project, including its purpose and key outcomes.]

**Example:**  
"This project involved building a cloud-native to-do application using a microservices architecture, containerized with Docker, and deployed on Kubernetes. The goal was to create a scalable and maintainable application while gaining hands-on experience with cloud-native technologies."

---

## Results and Impact
### Achieved Outcomes
[Summarize what you accomplished during the project. Be specific and include details about deliverables, milestones, and any measurable results.]

**Example:**  
- Designed and implemented a microservices architecture for the to-do application.  
- Containerized the application using Docker and deployed it on Kubernetes.  
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.  
- Documented the entire process for future reference and learning.

### Comparison with Expectations
[Compare the results with your initial goals and expectations. Were you successful? Did anything unexpected happen?]

**Example:**  
- **Expected:** Build a fully functional to-do application with a frontend, backend, and database.  
  - **Actual:** Successfully built and deployed the application, but the frontend design was simpler than planned due to time constraints.  
- **Expected:** Gain hands-on experience with Kubernetes.  
  - **Actual:** Gained significant experience with Kubernetes, but encountered challenges with debugging inter-service communication.
