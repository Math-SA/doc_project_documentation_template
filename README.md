### **1. Pre-Project Planning**
Before starting a project, define its scope, goals, and alignment with your career objectives. Use the **Pre-Project Plan Template** to document your plans.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Define the Project:**  
   - Write a brief overview of the project in the **Pre-Project Plan Template**.  
   - Example: "This project involves building a cloud-native to-do application using a microservices architecture, containerized with Docker, and deployed on Kubernetes."

2. **Set Goals and Expectations:**  
   - List the skills you aim to develop and the expected outcomes.  
   - Example: "Gain hands-on experience with Docker and Kubernetes."

3. **Align with Career Goals:**  
   - Write a goal alignment statement.  
   - Example: "This project aligns with my goal of becoming a Cloud Engineer."

4. **Log Tools and Resources:**  
   - List the tools, libraries, and resources you plan to use.  
   - Example: "Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions."

5. **Create a Timeline:**  
   - Outline a high-level timeline for the project.  
   - Example: "Week 1: Research and planning. Week 2-3: Build backend and frontend."

6. **Document in Repository:**  
   - Save the **Pre-Project Plan** in your project’s documentation repository.  
   - Example: `project-title/pre_project_plan.md`.

### **2. Project Execution and Documentation**
As you work on the project, maintain detailed logs of your progress, challenges, and solutions. Use the **Execution Log Template** and **AI Collaboration Log Template** to document your work.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Track Progress Weekly/Iteration:**  
   - Use the **Execution Log Template** to document your progress, challenges, and solutions for each week or iteration.  
   - Example: `project-title/execution_logs/week_1_execution_log.md`.

2. **Log AI Interactions:**  
   - Use the **AI Collaboration Log Template** to document interactions with AI tools.  
   - Example: `project-title/ai_collaboration_log.md`.

3. **Update Skill Tracking:**  
   - Track the skills you develop or demonstrate in the **Execution Log**.  
   - Example: "Gained proficiency in Docker and Kubernetes."

4. **Organize Artifacts:**  
   - Save all relevant artifacts (e.g., code, designs, reports) in the project repository.  
   - Example: `project-title/artifacts/`.

5. **Regularly Review and Iterate:**  
   - Periodically review your logs and make iterative improvements to the project.  
   - Example: "Refactored the backend to improve performance."

### **3. Post-Project Reflection**
After completing the project, reflect on your results, lessons learned, and future development options. Use the **Post-Project Reflection Template** to document your reflections.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Summarize Results and Impact:**  
   - Document the outcomes of the project in the **Post-Project Reflection Template**.  
   - Example: "Successfully built and deployed a cloud-native to-do application."

2. **Reflect on Lessons Learned:**  
   - Write about the skills you developed and the challenges you overcame.  
   - Example: "Learned how to design and implement a microservices architecture."

3. **Identify Future Development Options:**  
   - Outline potential next steps or extensions for the project.  
   - Example: "Add monitoring and logging using Prometheus and Grafana."

4. **Document in Repository:**  
   - Save the **Post-Project Reflection** in your project’s documentation repository.  
   - Example: `project-title/post_project_reflection.md`.

### **4. Portfolio Preparation**
Use the documentation from your project to create a polished portfolio description for recruiters. Use the **Summary Log Template** to summarize your work.

#### **Steps:**
1. **Create a Summary Log:**  
   - Use the **Summary Log Template** to create a high-level overview of the project.  
   - Example: `project-title/summary_log.md`.

2. **Prepare Portfolio Description:**  
   - Use the **Summary Log** and other documentation to write a concise project description for your portfolio.  
   - Example: "Developed a cloud-native to-do application using Docker and Kubernetes."

3. **Organize Artifacts for Portfolio:**  
   - Ensure all relevant artifacts (e.g., code, visuals, reports) are well-organized and accessible.  
   - Example: Include links to the GitHub repository and live demo in your portfolio.

4. **Update Portfolio Website:**  
   - Add the project to your portfolio website or LinkedIn profile.  
   - Example: "Featured Project: Cloud-Native To-Do Application."

### **Folder Structure**
Here’s how your project repository might look:

```
project-title/
├── execution_logs/
│   ├── week_1_execution_log.md
│   ├── week_2_execution_log.md
│   └── ...
├── ai_collaboration_log.md
├── pre_project_plan.md
├── post_project_reflection.md
├── summary_log.md
└── artifacts/ (e.g., code, designs, reports)
```
